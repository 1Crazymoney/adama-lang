Welcome, welcome, welcome...

This is the first update on the Adama language project!

I finally have set forth on the journey of telling people about my latest passion project. Surprise, it's a programming language! However, it is not a generic programming language, and I want to make this exceptionally clear. It's a domain specific programming language meant for board games. Yep, that's right! [Board Games!!!](/docs/why-the-origin-story). However, I have discovered this language has some very interesting properties which make it broadly applicable, and I have a vision for a new type of infrastructure!

Since there is not much to share about the project at the moment, and I am really just filling in the blog so I have some content. I'll share a bit about who I am and rant a bit. Maybe it will be entertaining! Let's see.

My day job is one of those "technical architects", "engineering leaders", and sometimes "code machine". I recently gave myself the title of "Dark Lord of Infrastructure Engineer". That is seriously the title on my business card, so it is definitely legit, right? Well, it simply means I've succumbed to the dark side, and I don't mean management. Instead, I find myself more driven by hate than anything else.

I hate.

I hate bad infrastructure.

I hate leaky abstractions which become infrastructure.

I hate unreliable infrastructure.

Seriously, I hate the way we define Infrastructure via web services, but what other choice is there? This is a serious question.

I also hate having to read a long ass list of products and realize that my core option is to buy stupid shit rather than build my own stupid shit where I have control. I hate buying shit because buying creates hard boundaries which more often than not requires some kludge or hack to make work well. I value reliability, and I believe reliability only comes from simplification where less is more. And, I don't mean less stuff to buy, but less total stuff period. However, simplification is exceptionally hard and extremely expensive for a multitude of reasons.

I'm that fucker that shaves the Yak, and I have issues. Worse yet, I sometimes will allow myself to be the enemy of the good and seek perfection. I have issues. After-all, one doesn't set forth to build a programming language unless one has serious fucking psychotic issues and hatreds!

The interesting thing however in that the psychotic issues which drive me to write this language has given me a deeper appreciation and understanding of the science in the field. In a way, I've got closer to the root of things and how we build, and I see a different evolutionary branch to take. I believe I've discovered something, and I intend to pull that thread to build a new glorious empire!

Adama is the first step in building out my glorious empire dedicated towards building a new web and redefining the landscape for how products are built, and it all started with the desire to make board games easy to build.

I hope you enjoy reading what I write, and I hope you eventually decide to drink the Kool-Aid about Adama.

Thank for your time.

And, if you hate it, then that's ok. I get it.
