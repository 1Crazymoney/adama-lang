It is a new year, and I have been incommunicado up until now. So, Iâ€™ll scream into the void of digital ether.

I am looking forward to 2021, so what is going to change? First, I do not intend to overpromise or commit to anything. This project is still alive, but on the back burner due to a lack of bandwidth. I believe in it, but I am focusing on self-care. This crazy pandemic has given me a great deal of time, and I am using it to work out and improve myself. I am doing so much self-care that my body is much appreciative, and I am regaining lost vitality. I feel great!

Fortunately, my habit changes went into effect on November 1st, 2020; this means these new life changes are not likely to fall into a state of failure like many new year resolutions. Instead of committing myself to more things this year, I am instead going to commit myself to less things. Sadly, for this project this means 
it will appear to stall out.

Instead of committing myself to a bunch of expensive execution, this year the focus is purely on strategy and thinking this project through the following decades. For instance, I feel that I may be too myopically focused on board games. Now, I love board games, but I have gotten to an interesting point where I need to build UIs.

Alas, there are many things I do not like about the way products are built today. It bothers me, and this hampers my commercial success. Fortunately, I am not striving for a commercial success this year, and this project exists mainly to amuse myself. However, if I find myself serious about this project in the coming years, I want to set myself up at least a hope and a prayer of success (in some way).

I know that I do not like the modern web tool chain, and I am looking into making yet another box-moving-vector-editing-package for making cross-platform UIs... 

So, what if? What if I went a bit further and made a full fledge editor? Adama was inspired by Excel, so what if I went all out and embraced this? What if I made something that average people could use to build products with a fully functional collaborative-real-time-version-history-document-centric backend? What if the product was as easy to use as Excel but with the rigors of modern engineering? I do not know, but I do know that I should play in this space for a bit and see how I like it.

This is a year to imagine the future!
