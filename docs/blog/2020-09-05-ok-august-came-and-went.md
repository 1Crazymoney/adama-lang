I did not get what I wanted [done in August](/blog/august-goal).

I am failure.

OK, that's dramatic, but that's the problem with TODO lists and procrastination.

I have a lot of changes happening in my life at this moment, but I have a bit more clarity. What is clear is that I need to pivot and focus on building things rather than the meta things. The short term goal has thus shifted to: ship something useful.

- [ ] Write something useful

So, my next update should be more meaningful.
