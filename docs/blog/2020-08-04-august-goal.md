August is upon us, and I feel good about how July went down. While I'm not making concrete steps towards the idealized milestone of launching a game, I am having fun polishing things. It is worth noting that the polishing found game-ending bugs, so this has been a worthwhile process. August is go-time, and I need to start telling more and more people about this project. So, with that, I'll enumerate concrete goals for August. Note, this blog post will update with changes.

- [x] Finish migrating all code from private repo.
- [ ] Write a better README.md
- [x] README: Photo of Adama
- [ ] README: Tighten the introduction and make it clear and cheeky
- [ ] README: Some badges?
- [x] README: An Animated GIF
- [ ] README: Step by Step setup guide (With Binaries / Building Binaries)
- [ ] README: How to use and build a product
- [ ] Finish a reasonable first pass of documentation
- [ ] DOCS: Each section shows working code
- [ ] DOCS: Each section has a fast intro
- [ ] DOCS: Each section has a bullet list of details that I hope to explore
- [ ] Polish up error messages language
- [x] Write tool to dump all error messages from unit tests
- [x] Integrate with vscode
- [x] VSCODE: Super basic LSP over Socket
- [x] VSCODE: Syntax highlights
- [ ] Polish up error messages alignment with document
- [x] Resolve all the erroneous error line numbers 0, 2.5B
- [ ] Make Three Demos
- [x] Demo: Chat
- [x] Chat Cast Study
- [ ] Demo: Lobby
- [ ] Lobby Case Study
- [ ] Demo: Hearts Game

Obviously, the best way forward after telling people is to make games with it.
