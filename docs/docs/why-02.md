title: Lazyness as a Virtue

A core principle within Adama is that we should off-load as much work as possible to the language and run-time. We should be lazy and allow the language to do some valuable heavy lifting for us. The question then is how can the language help with building real things.

Well, the challenge is that most of the "serious programmer" languages these days are within a narrow band and do similar enough things. Worse yet, we can be rather discriminatory when it comes to languages. For instance, consider Dijskstra once wrote:

> It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

Now, he was railing against a different BASIC than what you or I may know. I was raised with QBasic which I would then leverage in Visual Basic for Applications. If you are a professional software engineer, then you may even sneer at VBA. However, we should ask why is VBA still used and learned. Is it just inertia? Or, is it that it is simple enough for simple tasks, and people can understand it. Not only can they understand it, they can hack it!

Don't get me wrong, there are great reasons to hate on Basic/VBA; however, the antedote is not to force people to contend with category theory. Adama aims to bridge this in a reasonable and clear enough way, and the key is to be lazy. Specically, Adama intends to co-opt the most accessible programming model ever devised: Excel.

Excel is the rallying cry for Adama because Excel is just so fucking awesome at being productive. The challenge with Excel is that one can not build a product with it that ships to everyone in the world in a competitive way that "serious languages" allow "serious programmers" to build web products. My hope with Adama is to be as productive in Excel except with pure text, and enable building great product experiences which are reliable and live.

Currently, I do not intend to test Adama beyond 1000 connected people in a game. 1000 seems like a good limit for a board game. The mental model for this language is that 1000 people can connect to an 


I once tried to describe functional programming to a non-technical person, and it did not go well. I think there is a great deal of valuable technical stuff to learn from functional programming.


However, it is not yet intutiive, but you know what is intutitive: Excel.
