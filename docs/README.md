# Adama Documentation

This documentation is hosted at http://www.adama-lang.org/ for the Adama Programming Language which is a programming language for board games.

# Developing

This documentation is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
yarn deploy
```

This will deploy to the build subdirectory which is a copy of the website. Deployment is not automated at this time.
