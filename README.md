This whole thing started as a way to simplify the engineering of online board games, and somehow with some [Yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) ended up as a custom database and programming language. It's something neat, so let's get started!

# AdamaDB & Adama Programming Language
This is a near-complete platform-as-a-service in a box for building complex products (namely board games).

Now, this begs the question: why on earth do board games need their own programming language. Well, many modern board games are exceptionally hard to model because they rely on the human mind to evaluate the complex interactions which emerge from a loose set of rules.

Adama aims to simplify the process of building a board game by providing a curated set of idioms which allow expressing the board games rules with low mental effort.

# 0.1 Release --> On the way
Well, I've re-written many aspects and simplified it while I've expanded it. The current situation is that this is a complete mess, but the core package is online with the translator and runtime. However, there is no server release at this time.
