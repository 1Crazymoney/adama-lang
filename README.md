# AdamaDB & Adama Programming Language
The mission of Adama is to simplify building online board games. With a bit of spit, polish, and some [Yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving), it ended up as a custom database and programming language. So, let's talk about what this thing is, and this animated GIF is a good summary:

Neat, right? Adama, the language, is a way of laying out state and then defining how to manipulate that state within a closed container. Manipulation of state is done by people, and the entire purpose is to play an online board game. This extends beyond board games, but it will take time to communicate those extensions. For now, the key is that players connect to a shared document, and the document enforces both rules and privacy via the Adama langauge.
