# Adama Programming Language
A language, run-time, and service platform for building board games online. Now, this begs the question: why on earth do board games need their own programming language. Well, many modern board games are exceptionally hard to model because they rely on the human mind to evaluate the complex interactions which emerge from a loose set of rules.

Adama aims to simplify the process of building a board game by providing a curated set of idioms which allow expressing the board games rules with low mental effort. For more information on why, please refer to [the origin story](http://www.adama-lang.org/docs/why-the-origin-story) over at http://www.adama-lang.org/

# 0.1 Release --> On the way
Well, I've re-written many aspects and simplified it while I've expanded it. The current situation is that this is a complete mess, but the core package is online with the translator and runtime. However, there is no server release at this time.
